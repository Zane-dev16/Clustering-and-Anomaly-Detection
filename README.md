# Clustering-and-Anomaly-Detection
A project that utilizes several unsupervised learning techniques to deal with the the popular Iris, Moons and Mnist datasets, and several other randomly generated datasets. 

## Notebook Categories

The following notebooks can be found in the `notebooks/` directory:

- **k_means.ipynb**: Utilization of the k-means algorithm for tackling the datasets
- **dbscan.ipynb**: Utilization of the dbscan algorithms for tackling the datasets
- **gaussian_mixtures.ipynb**: Utilization of the gaussian mixtures for tackling the datasets

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
